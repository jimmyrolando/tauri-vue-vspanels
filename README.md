# VSCODE-LIKE Panels in Tauri and Vue 3

Simple implementation of a layout with panels very similar to those of monaco-editor used in vscode. Just for the sake of learning.


My main goal was simplicity, all you will need to use it is in "acme" folder.


## How to test

1. Clone this repo e.g: `git clone https://github.com/jimmyrolando/tauri-vue-vspanels.git`

2. Navigate to the folder.

2. Install dependecies e.g.: `npm install` 

3. Run tauri dev e.g.: `npm run tauri dev`

4. Let's have fun
